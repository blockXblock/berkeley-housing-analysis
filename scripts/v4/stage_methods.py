"""v4 pipeline stage METHODS — universal, parameterized; each reads its Berkeley CALIBRATION
from corrections/v4/. THE importable home (the aa6ded0 lift discipline): JN-B / JN-C / JN-F
notebooks and the rebuild drivers IMPORT these — never re-define them as cell-strings.

Validated from-raw 2026-07-02 (scratch/2026-07-02/ drivers): GATE PASS — CO 3,676 / BP 3,945 /
events == live / counted-completion set == live with 0 differences. Hardened same day after the
8-angle review: verify-or-halt on rc==0 (a missing calibration target halts; only a verified
already-applied state passes), calibration checksums re-pinned (calibration_checksums.json),
held-items externalized (held_items.json), keeper-survival + CO-neutrality dedup guards,
NULL-payload differ detection, rollback-on-failure in every write method.

Faithful re-expressions of the gated one-shot writes (scratch/2026-06-2{8,9}/*_write.py, audits
docs/audit/2026-06-2{8,9}_*), re-shaped from "mutate the live DB once" to "apply to a REBUILD db
as a pipeline stage". Snapshots/restore are deliberately absent — the target is a throwaway
rebuild (caller guards the live DB); every method is idempotent-via-verify and rolls back its
transaction on any failed guard.
